This maze game is a creation using the Pygame library, in Python. Here's an overview of the game;

Game Title; Maze Game

Goal;
Guide your way through mazes to find the exit ('E') while steering clear of obstacles (walls marked with '#') and a wandering monster. The adventure begins at the entrance ('S').

How to Play;

Control the player character (a circle) by using the arrow keys to move up left or right.
Navigate around walls that block your path.
Watch out for a roaming monster (a circle) that moves unpredictably and avoid bumping into it.
Progress through levels by reaching the exit. Each level presents a maze layout and monster movement pattern.
The game records the time taken to finish each level.

Win Condition;
Successfully navigate all mazes to complete the game. Your total completion time is shown at the end.

Losing Scenario;
Colliding with walls encountering the monster or straying beyond boundaries leads to defeat. You can restart from your level upon losing.

Special Features;

 maze designs, for every level.

The monster moves around unpredictably altering its course upon hitting walls. The background music varies with each level. There is a timer to track completion time for each level. Please note that this game is an example and can be enhanced with more elements, levels and difficulties. It acts as a foundation, for developing maze games using Pygame.
